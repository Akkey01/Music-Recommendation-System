ðŸŽµ Music Recommendation System
NYU Data Science Bootcamp - Best Project Award

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was developed as part of the NYU Data Science Bootcamp, an 8-week intensive program where we completed weekly assignments and, in the final week, presented a capstone project. I chose to build a Music Recommendation System, which was awarded the Best Project Presentation Award.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project was to create an AI-driven music recommendation system that provides personalized song suggestions based on user preferences.

ðŸ”§ Methodology
Algorithms Used: Implemented KNN, K-Means, Fuzzy Wuzzy, and Lime to improve recommendation accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured datasets using Pandas & NumPy for efficient processing.
Feature Engineering: Applied clustering and similarity matching algorithms to enhance recommendation quality.
API Development: Built an interactive API that allows users to enter a song and receive real-time music recommendations.
Evaluation & Deployment: Assessed model performance and deployed an interface for user interaction.
ðŸ“Š Key Features

âœ” Personalized music recommendations using machine learning models.

âœ” Advanced clustering and similarity matching for improved accuracy.

âœ” API-based song input system that generates recommended songs dynamically.

âœ” Awarded Best Project Presentation in the NYU Data Science Bootcamp.
